        #  producing a motorrecommendation.

        #  a winning behavior andreturn that behaviorâ€™s motor recommendations and halt request flag.

        #  the settings of all motors.

        #5. Wait - This pause (in code execution) will allow the motor settings to remain active
        #  for a short period of time, e.g., one half second, thus producing activity in the robot, such as moving forward or turning.
